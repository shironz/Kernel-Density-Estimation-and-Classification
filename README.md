This is a final project for the Math9810 course "Machine Learning".

Kernel density estimation is a non-parametric estimation of the probability density function of random variable. Usually, we can use the histogram for a non-parametric estimation if the data we have is discrete. However, if the data is continuous, then we need to consider the Kernel density function. It is also an unsupervised learning and it can be used for
classification, which is Kernel density classification. We will introduce these non parametric estimations and compare these to linear discriminant classifier.
